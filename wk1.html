      <h2>Building this website</h2>
      <p>
        To record the work that I will be doing throughout this course, I will be coding developing this website using html. I will also be using css to style the pages and javaScript where appropriate. I decided to use divs in the development of the site so that I can keep my code organised. This also helps me simplify my css code.

      <h2>Newspaper tower</h2>
      <p>
        Our first project was, using only sheets of newspaper and tape, to build the tallest tower that could also withstand airflow from a fan. Our group decided to build a tripod base for the tower and add as many rolls of newspaper we could on top of the base. We managed to get a stable tower with 3 rolls of newspaper above the tripod base.
