        CNC Milling
      </h2>
      <p>
        CNC Milling is a process in which a 3D model constructed in CAD software is translated into instructions for a milling machine through CAM software and carved out from a block of material  (subtractive manufactuing), often through the use of a high power waterjet.

        Creating a mould
      </h2>
      <p>
        We created a chocolate mould for this project by first taking a pattern and then creating a 3D model of it in CAD. We then created a reciprocal of that model before putting it in a CAM software so that
        it could be milled by the CNC machine.
