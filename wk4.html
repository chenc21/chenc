          Cutting and Engraving
        </h2>
        <p>
          Lasers can be used to engrave patterns or messages on material such as wood and anodised aluminium. The laser acts like a pencil that creates the pattern by burning the material. Laser cutting operated somewhat similarly but rather than burning the material to create a mark, the laser is focused through optics to burn through the material. These processes are extremely precise and are relatively cheap and easy to execute so are widely used in undustrial applications.

        Laser cutting a clock
      </h2>
      <p>
        For this part of the project, we were to design a clock and then produce it by laser cutting vinyl records. I decided to laser cut out an outline of the Galileo spacecraft. While designing and cutting the clock I also had to make sure that the cutout avoided the middle of the disk so that I could still be able to fit on the clock mechanics later on.

        Laser engraving
      </h2>
      <p>
        I decided to laser engrave a leather phone card holder for this part of the project. I decided to engrave a pulsar star map onto the holder as it was a simpler design that only consisted of line drawings that would probably give the laser engraver a better time of recreating the image.
