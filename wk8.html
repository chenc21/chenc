        Soldering
      </h2>
      <p>
        The process of soldering involves using a solder (which can be either lead or non-lead based) to complete a circuit permenantly. The solder acts like a glue that connects two wires, it is liquidified during the soldering process and solidifies very quickly afterwards. Almost all circuit boards today use soldering to connect components to the circuit. Sometimes those electrical components are polarised (eg. LED bulbs, diodes, microcontrollers etc.) meaning that they have to be connected to the circuit in a speciifc configuration (positive end must align with the positive side of the circuit and vice versa).

        Soldering a LED board
      </h2>
      <p>
        For this project we had to complete a circuit board that consisted of a flashing LED bulb. Non-leaded solder was used in the project so a temperature setting of 750 degrees for the solder iron was used. To solder the components, the leads first had to be threaded through the PCB. Then, with the solder touching the metal contact on the PCB, the solder iron had to be placed on the solder to allow it to melt and create a good connection between the lead and the metal contact. The solder had to be in a spherical shape and be polished to have adequate connection. Once this was done and the connection was verified to be good, the ends of the leads were cut off. Resistors, LED bulbs, Transistors, Capacitors and Switches were used for this project.
