        Different manufacturing processes
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are three main types of manufactuing processes - Additive, Subtractive and Moulding. 3D Printing is an additive manufacturing process where material is deposited in the shape of the final product. This is very useful for prototype development and is very cost effective where production is low. This is different from subtractive manufacturing, where the product is carved (usually CNC milled) from a block of material, and from moulding, where the product is formed by shaping the material in a hollowed out block with a reciprocal shape of the product (a mould). Subtractive manufactuing and moulding are much more commonly used in mass production as they can be significantly cheaper and more efficient where production is high.

        3D Scanning
      </h2>
      <p>
        For this part of the project, we had to 3D Print a model of our faces. To do this, 3D scanning was used to construct a 3D model of our faces that we could view and modify on a computer. We combined the 3D model with a pedastal in meshmixer before exporting the final model to be 3D printed.

        Constructing 3D models
      </h2>
      <p>
        We also had to create 3D models in Fusion 360 that had to be original and be useful in some way. I designed a headphone holder and a cable manager that I could stick onto the sides of my desk. While the headphone holder worked quite well, I misjudged the size for the holes for the cables of the cable manager and they ended up being too large to be of any use. The orientation in which I printed this also meant that the holders where slightly disformed from the material shifting downwards and I hadn't accounted for this while constructing the model.
