        In this assignment, we had to recreate 6 sketches from <a href = "https://fab.wra.net/caddraw2018.pdf">here</a> using Fusion 360. The files and screenshots of the 6 sketches are linked below.

        Creating a laser cut laptop stand
      </h2>
      <p>
        In this assignment, I followed a tutorial to make a laser cut laptop stand in Fusion 360. To do this, I created 5 seperate parts - 2 legs, supports and then top and used joints to connect them together. The idea was that I would have the 2 legs holding up a rectangular plate for the laptop and have 2 horizontal support bars running underneath to prop up the legs and hold the entire stand in place.
