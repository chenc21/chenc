        Designing and printing a T-shirt
      </h2>
      <p>
        For this assignment, we designed an original T-shirt about Hudson, WRA or Ohio with CorelDraw. For my T-shirt I decided to create a relatively simple design with a silhouette of the clock tower in Hudson inside of an outline of Ohio.

      <h2>
        Dye sublimation design
      </h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the shirt, we also had to design something that would use dye sublimation for printing. Dye sublimation is a process in which the printer uses heat to transfer dye onto various different materials such as fabric, card or paper. For this part of the project, I printed a shot of a CPU die onto a fabric pencil case.

      <h2>
        UV PRINTING
      </h2>
      <p>
        We also print a design on somthing using UV printing, a process where UV rays is used to dry or cure ink as it is printed. For this part of the project, I printed a concentric circle design onto a popsocket (although the design turned out to be slightly off center).
