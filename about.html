      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently a sophomore at WRA and am taking the Digital Fabrication and Engineering course. I will be recording my projects and progress in the class as well as any projects that I do on this website as well as a brief introduction to topics covered in each week of the course. I am interested in digital fabrication as I want to learn more about 3D modelling and CAD. I am also interested in project involving card-sized computers (particularly RPi). I hope to learn about the process of designing using computers in this course.
