        Creating a skateboard
      </h2>
      <p>
        For this project, we had to create a skateboard and decorate it through vacuum forming and lamination. To shape the skateboard, we first had to glue together 5 wooden boards (2 of which were flexible while 3 were rigid). After that, the boards were put on a styrofoam mould and then those were put inside of a bag. The bag was then sealed tight with tar and air was pumped out of the bag to create a vacuum. This would then force the wooden boards into the shape of the mould to create the base of the skateboard. After this was done, the boards were laminated so that they could be decorated. I ended up using stickers that I had created in the previous unit to decorate the board (this consited of 2 coloured and 1 solid blue sticker).
